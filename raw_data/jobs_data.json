I'd like them built in a similar html/java format.\n\nSecond, if possible, I'd like to have my Blog and FAQ pages rebuilt on Wordpress, rather than the HTML formatting.

    "cover_letter": "Hi! Just came across your proposal here and I'm enthusiastic about helping you enhance your website.\n\nCreating dedicated location pages is a great move, and having landing pages that are easy to advertise against and build SEO authority is very smart. Working on https://www.tedtoddinsurance.com/ we created many pages like this for specific types of customers, although eventually they had so many locations they opted to list them all on one page. \n\nSwitching your Blog and FAQ to WordPress is a practical move, but there are many potential downsides I have spent decades working with. However, considering security, stability and performance, I'd recommend Craft CMS (https://craftcms.com) as it provides a robust platform that's both secure and highly performant, https://straussglobal.com is a good example of a network of sites I built using this platform that they have been on through 2 design updates over the past 5 years.\n\nFor the form rebuild, leveraging javascript (I believe thats what you meant) for more nuanced customization is within my expertise. I ensure the forms are not only functional but also integrated with your site's aesthetics and user flow.\n\nBuilding long-term partnerships is key to my approach; I value the opportunity to provide continuous improvement and strategic advice as your business grows\n\nI look forward to potentially partnering with you and contributing to your website's success.\n\nWarm regards,\nAaron",

We believe that 52 pages will need to be manually migrated. The remaining 26 pages may be able to automatically migrated using the Blog Importer tool.\n\nI believe that the entire transition can be accomplished with these templates: \n- header\n- footer (to include google ratings plug-in)\n\nPage templates (used for 90% of the site):\n- Blog post template\n- Services Page Template\n- Provider profile template\n- Legal content template (for our privacy policy, terms & conditions, accessibility... pages)\n\nOne-off pages:\n- Home page\n- Schedule Appointment page\n- Services links page\n- Provider overview page\n- Patient Portal page\n- Insurances we accept\n- Images, Virtual tour gallery\n- About Us page\n\nOther (links out to our support vendors):\n- link(s) out to our self-scheduling tool (embedded in our \"Schedule Appointment\") (links need to stay the same)\n- link out to the patient's log-in page for the medical portal (embedded in our \"Patient Portal\" page)\n- link out to our Covid Testing scheduling tool (will need to put into the \"Covid testing\" services page)\n\nPlease note that I have an offline version of the entire site and the website sitemap. \n\nKeeping the current site map seems critical to us! We do not want to lose any SEO/Site performance we have gained over the last few years. \n\nAlso, we will need to include help with installing a site translation feature to make the site accessible to our Spanish-speaking patient demographic. \n\nWe are in a huge hurry, so starting ASAP would be required. Our current site vendor agreement ends on 4/30... (I'm trying to get an extension, but it is not a sure thing). \n\nGetting the site over is the priority!\nMaking it look modern, new, and fresh can happen after, and take more time. \n____\nOnce the site is transitioned, we would like to retain services on a project basis, for help with SEO optimization (to include Key word stuff, site speed/performance, backlinking efforts, etc.). \n\nIn addition, we would love someone to help us with landing page (funnel page) development for specific targeted marketing efforts that we plan to engage with. \n\nOur current plan is to transition the site to WordPress so we have more control and creativity with our site.

    "job_description": "I need an experienced coach/teacher in the Austin, Texas area to teach me how to receive a served volleyball. When I receive, the ball usually flies out of bounds to the left or right.",
    "cover_letter": "As fate would have it, you've reached a non-volleyball-playing individual who doesn't even live in Austin, Texas, willing to give advice on receiving a served volleyball. So here I am, armed with an internet connection and a desire to help, offering you some tips to improve your reception skills. While I may not have firsthand experience, I've done my research to provide you with useful pointers. You should probably check out local volleyball clubs rather than upwork, I doubt you'll find anyone here that will meet your needs.\n\nBut, here are some key pointers to consider when receiving a served volleyball:\n\nProper stance: Stand with your feet shoulder-width apart and slightly staggered, with your knees bent and your weight on the balls of your feet. This allows you to react quickly and move in any direction as needed.\n\nPlatform technique: To create a solid platform, extend your arms out in front of you and clasp your hands together by interlocking your thumbs and keeping your palms flat. Your elbows should be straight, and your hands should be positioned about waist level.\n\nBall tracking and positioning: Keep your eyes on the ball as it approaches you. Position yourself so that the ball will contact the middle of your forearms, ideally between your wrists and elbows. Make sure your platform is angled slightly upward, which will help direct the ball towards your target.\n\nAbsorb and redirect: As the ball makes contact with your forearms, use your legs to absorb the impact by bending your knees slightly. This will help control the ball's trajectory. At the same time, redirect the ball towards your target by angling your platform in the desired direction. Remember not to swing your arms or use your wrists, as this can cause the ball to go out of bounds.\n\nFollow-through: After making contact with the ball, continue to move your platform in the direction of your target. This follow-through helps ensure the ball goes where you intend it to.\n\nIn conclusion, while I may not be the ideal volleyball guru you were seeking, I hope these tips have provided you with a starting point to up your game. Remember, practice makes perfect, so keep at it and, who knows, you might just become a volleyball legend! Wishing you all the best in your journey towards volleyball mastery. May your serves be powerful, your receptions be accurate, and your opponents be forever in awe of your newfound skills!\n\nBest,\n-Aaron",

I can work with you to identify any necessary changes or updates to the design and layout and ensure that it aligns with your brand and business goals.\n\nAs a full-stack developer, I can also handle the technical aspects of the website, such as hosting, security, and maintenance. I have experience with various technologies, including HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other web development frameworks, which will allow me to create a website that is responsive, fast, and optimized for search engines.\n\nI'm passionate about helping businesses succeed online and have experience working with start-ups to build websites from the ground up. I'm confident that I can help you create a website that effectively communicates your message and encourages visitors to engage with your brand.\n\nPlease let me know if you have any questions or if you'd like to discuss the project further. I look forward to the opportunity to work with you.\n\nBest regards,\nAaron",

It looks like you have already gotten a number of proposals, so I will keep this short: I created a similar web app not so long ago for a firm in Boston (ironically for exactly $10k) that used the entire database of owned homes in Boston, and then crawled AirBNB and compared the listing with the city assessors information I had synced up. This allowed the client to identify the owners of any AirBNB listings (information that is hidden until you actually book a space) within a specific variance of certainty. \nSince at the time Boston was passing a law that you couldn't rent out an airbnb unless you lived in the residence a percentage of the year, this allowed the firm to target AirBNB owners with offers to buy their properties. \nI am working now on getting the prototype back online so you can see it, if you are interested in it let me know! I am an expert designer and full stack developer, based in NY and available to chat anytime about your project.\nHope to hear from you!\n-Aaron",

We need to publish this site as soon as it is feasible.\n1) We need expertise finding and licensing up to 12 images for our draft landing page. These images need to reflect our brand.\n2) Four to nine of these images will go into a carousel that has already been built on the site. If the time and cost to include 9 is too much, then we can reduce to four or more images.\n3) We need design expertise to add a feature/selling points section with 3 of these images and brief copy. \n4) We would like to establish anchors on the top of the page, so visitors can easily navigate to the sections of interest. \n5) I believe there are key data that should be in the bottom section of any website, such as About Us, Feedback, Trust, Safety, & Security, Help & Support, Cookie Settings, Accessibility, Enterprise Solutions. We don't have Terms of Service, a formal Privacy Policy, or a formal Cookie Policy yet. We need guidance and help on ensuring the standard items we do have are in place. \n6) Finally, from a design perspective, if this expert has suggestions on how to make the site look more modern, we are open to amending the landing page if needed. \n7) If time and funding allows, we do have a survey that we would like to offer to visitors.

Many moons have passed, and in their light I have seen sites, businesses, even empires rise and fall from my remote location. In this theater of capitalistic avarice my work stood like the walls of Constantinople, enduring as a bright and shining example of performance and efficiency all while absorbing the waves of automation tools, programming frameworks, design principals, and SEO recommendations. \nHaving built an illustrious and lucrative career in such a way I have large swaths of time and energy available, I am now available to the right team part or full time, or as a hired gun. I am interested in work that is challenging and interesting, and am always willing to learn new and exciting things. I am sure there are a bevy of talented young juniors out there, but figured I'd spend a few minutes breaking the monotony for both of our sake on this happy Monday!\nHope this finds you well, reach out if you want to talk about working together in any way whatsoever.\nBest,\n-Aaron",

Not trying to be critical, i am sure you have your reasons for using webflow, in my experience it is very weak managing stuff like this without constant headaches.\nI would recommend Craft CMS, its headless by design and has graphql built in, which could be really helpful if you are ever trying to access this knowledge-base from with your standalone apps.",

I have a functioning website course setup, however I think I could get better conversions with a sales page (page with a trailer and a bunch of sales jargon). What I want is a basic page to paste a video and add text with a sign up button. ( I already have Paypal set up, and I already have the ability to accept payments, just need those functions moved to the sales page). (Also I already have a coded in website builder, just add an extension to that code to allow me to customize the sales page that you set up).\n\n2. My current website is zandersharp.com, but for some bizarre reason it has austinwilder.com in the webpage description on google, need that fixed.\n\n3. Clone the code used in AWS for zandersharp.com and put it into another website that I'm going to set up on Amazon AWS (domain already purchased, zanderfinance.com). Now obviously my current website sells books and this new website is an investment/stock alert service so visually they'll look different in the end, however for now just copy the back end functionality of zandersharp.com. There will be another separate paying job in the future where I'll have you do front end work to make zanderfinance.com look like a stock trading website, but that will be after this job is completed.\n\n\nSo overall the job is to throw up a basic webpage that can accept text, images, and videos, then just figure out a few problems I've been having with the google search website description, copy and paste some code previously wrote for zandersharp.com into zanderfinance.com... and that's it. An easy $1000 less\nMore/Less about",

I took a look at your existing site (zandersharp.com) and can see where the meta needs to be updated, and reviewed at least the front end of what you have together so far. All looks totally manageable and easy to understand what your goals are, and how I can help you out.\nWould love to hear more about your needs, and answer any questions you might have about my experience or what I can bring to the table.\nTalk soon,\nAaron",

You need a site designed, built and launched based on your current brand and vision, potentially within 2 weeks. I'm guessing since your current site is on wix, that is why you specified a wix template. \n\nThe concept: I am a top notch designer and developer that has honed my skills over more than a decade building fast, stable, and secure products that can work with you collaboratively on updating your web presence.\nThe test: I have successfully procured this exact service without fail for clients large and small. I have worked with many individuals like yourself looking to promote a service or product, as well as companies rebuilding or relaunching.\nThe competition: A substantial amount of my career has been spent fixing other peoples unqualified efforts. There are certainly gifted people in the space, but none with the candor, attention to detail, and specific experience I can bring to the table.\nThe platform: Upwork is fairly limiting, but I have also gone ahead and sent you a connect invite on linkedin. In addition to our communication here, you can also see my network, and work history.\nThe path: A bit of a stretch applying this to our work here, but commitment to strong and clear communication coupled with firm and mutually agreed upon expectations should be the most important decision we make in how to proceed together.\nThe proposal: Let's get in touch and figure out how I can help you launch this new design. \n\nI know this is a real coarse attempt at utilizing all the elements you think are important, but hopefully it helped illustrate the care I have for every project I even potentially can be a part of.\nI hope to hear from you, if you decide to engage with someone else I wish you the best of luck in your relaunch.

However, we\u2019re also open to other designs or themes as well.\n\nThe site currently uses WP Bakery for page layouts. We would like to switch to Elemantor with the new launch. \n\n// Customization of Theme\nThe customization of the theme is critical to the success of the website. This will include basic customization options in the theme.\n\nCustom Post-Types include: \nNetworks\nCertifications\nOnline Courses\nLearning Resource Library\nPeople\nSpeaker\u2019s Bureau\n\n// Integration and Customization of Plugins\nWe use several plugins that provide end-user functionality will need to be themed or adjusted to match the style of the new website.

The php customization already exists and can be copied to the new site. \n\nEvents Schedule WP Plugin. Add CSS so the schedule matches the website appearance. Modifications to PHP might be needed.\n\nWP Grid Builder. Add CSS and change configuration so that grids match the design of the site. This is the plugin we use to display most of our custom post-types. \n\nFormidable Forms Pro. Add CSS so the forms match the website appearance. \n\nGTranslate. Not sure what integration is necessary, and we\u2019re open to using a different plugin as long as it can stylistically fit with the site.\n\nRecent Posts Widget Extended. Not sure what integration is necessary, and we\u2019re open to using a different plugin to add engagement on blogs. \n\nAdmin White Label Login. We can use a different login page, but the login needs to be match the theme. \n\n// Design of All Pages. \nIn addition to design customization, the design will need to review each page and make layout/design adjustments. We currently have 66 pages and 92 posts. \n\nPHASE 2\n\nDuring Phase 2, we intend to merge two additional websites with our main website. Design specs will be worked on prior to this stage. \n\nWebsites to merge: \nIl-edtech.org becomes ietc.ltcillinois.org\nIltpp.org becomes iltpp.ltcillinois.org\n\nPHASE 3 (Optional)\n\nLead the design integration of multiple platforms, including Higher Logic, Canvas, and a Member Portal. less\nMore/Less about",
    "cover_letter": "I would love to speak with you further about this project, and appreciate the time and effort put into the requirements spec sheet you provided. After review, I would strongly advise you use your available budget to migrate away from wordpress. I understand this can be a sticking point for many, so I am not sending a full proposal at this time, but would love to hear from you if you are open to discussing your options.\nI have worked with wordpress for over 10 years, and in the last 3 have worked tirelessly to move my clients (and others) away from the platform when appropriate. It is not secure, requires constant maintenance and updates to keep it moving fast enough for an ever-increasing majority of mobile users, and the plugin ecosystem is rife with messy, incomplete code bases. While it remains one of the most popular options, for individuals or businesses within a certain spending range, wordpress ends up being a black hole for technology budgets, with return on investment based highly on circumstantial or unproven dependancies. \nThe primary alternative for any client within a $5-25k budget range is Craft CMS (https://craftcms.com/). It is stable, fast, highly extensible, has true first party support as well as strong community activity. \nI have personally used this CMS to build sites from non-profit and charity organizations to single page artist sites that managed hundreds of thousands of views per day. Its commerce component is also fully realized and much more stable and secure than any wordpress alternative. \n\nYou can see a few sites I have built similar to your project scale recently here:\nhttps://ibaboston.org/ \nhttp://thestrausslawfirm.com/\nhttp://hamiltoncaptivemanagement.com/\nhttps://www.supplyit.com/ \n\nIf this is something your team would consider, please reach out. I would love to jump on a call and discuss in more detail your project and its specifications, and how I can help you exceed your goals with this project. Once we have had a chance to review and see if this is a viable direction for you, I will be happy to update this proposal with details specific to how we will be addressing each one of your sites requirements.\n\nHope to hear from you!\nThanks,\n-Aaron",

One in particular that launched a couple months sounds similar in scope to what you are trying for, https://supplyit.com. This particular client provides a software solution for food services that aids in everything from inventory to production management. I designed and built the site as well as consulted on marketing integration and landing page variations. \nI have also built and maintained sites specific to the utility/infrastructure sectors, although I am currently covered by NDA so can't discuss in any detail.
